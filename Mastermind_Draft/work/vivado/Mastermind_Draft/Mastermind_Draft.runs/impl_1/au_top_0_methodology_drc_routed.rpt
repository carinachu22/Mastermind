TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.174 ns between man/FSM_sequential_M_phase_q_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_0) and man/FSM_sequential_M_phase_q_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.177 ns between man/FSM_sequential_M_phase_q_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_0) and man/M_phase_q_reg_rep[6]/D (clocked by clk_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
