## Task    
Design and build an electronic arcade game using a 16-bit ALU, using Alchitry Au FPGA 

## Mastermind with a twist (1-Player) 
Mastermind is a code-breaking game, where there will be a predetermined set of 4 colours and players have to guess it. The computer will output hints based on each guess. Red and white hints will be given with the following conditions:
- Red hints: Both colour and position of guess is correct 
- White hint: Correct colour, wrong position 

The objective of the game is for the player to guess all 4 colours correct and achieve 4 red hints with 8 tries. 

There are 2 versions to the game: Normal mode and Imposter mode. 
Normal mode is with typical Mastermind rules. Imposter mode has one fake hint that is an "imposter", and players have to decipher which is the fake hint and guess the corect answer.
